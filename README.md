# Preliminary Research Report

In the current research for my subtopic—defining stress and anxiety—I have found a list of five potential sources. These sources have not only given me scientifically accurate data, but they have also helped me strategize the best ways to organize the five pages I am personally responsible for.

## [What Is The Difference Between Stress And Anxiety? by Nicole Beasley | May 2020 | BetterHelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/stress/what-is-the-difference-between-stress-and-anxiety/?utm_source=AdWords&utm_medium=Search_PPC_c&utm_term=_b&utm_content=77548444015&network=g&placement&target&matchtype=b&utm_campaign=6459244691&ad_type=text&adposition&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_fiLBhDOARIsAF4khR3TPtc0HB0vptX7QEO8g3v7vWHACrKg9_yw_QcDsN0RFfeCpmbT-G4aAqm-EALw_wcB)

* **Credibility**: Nicole Beasley has been a researcher and writer since 2006 and now has written content for hundreds of publications, websites, and ebooks. Ms. Beasley also has a degree in business management. As somone with bipolar disorder, she is personally interested in the content she writes.
    * Additionally, this article has been updated for accuracy and was medically reviewed by Wendy Boring-Bray, DBH, LPC—a member of BetterHelp's editorial staff. 
* Overall, does a great job comparing and contrasting between stress and anxiety. I especially like the list of medical symptoms. Those could potentially become charts or visuals in the five pages I am responsible for. 

## [What’s the difference between stress and anxiety? | September 2020 | American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/topics/stress/anxiety-difference)

* **Credibility**: The American Psychological Association is an official organization filled with qualified professionals and researchers. Also contains a list of references and names two PhD professionals who influenced the article.
* This article is well-written and concise. The reference list may help me find additional sources to use in my subtopic. The most useful, unique aspect of this article are the statistics on anxiety. Those could be quoted or used to create a visual. 

## [Stress vs. Anxiety – Knowing the Difference Is Critical to Your Health by Franzi Ross | June 2018 | Mental Health First Aid](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/external/2018/06/stress-vs-anxiety/)

* **Credibility**: Mental Health First Aid USA is managed by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing. As a government-run organization, accuracy is important. I believe Franzi Ross has been writing for Mental Health First Aid since 2012, but I'm not 100 percent sure on that because the website was difficult to navigate.
* The other sources have touched on this, but I liked how this article talked about sources of stress being external while sources of anxiety are internal. I could have a section in my five pages covering external vs internal. The use of the word chronic to differentiate between stress and anxiety is also particularly useful. I may want to find a source specifically discussing and defining chronic illnesses.

## [Stress vs. anxiety: How to tell the difference by Amanda Barrell | April 2020 | Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stress-vs-anxiety)

* **Credibility**: Amanda Barrell is a freelance journalist, ediotr, and copywriter who covers health and medical education. She's written dozens and dozens of articles for Medical News Today. This article was also medically reviewed by Timothy J. Legg, Ph.D., CRNP.
* Most of the information in this source echoes the sentiments of my other sources. I would love to use or reference this visual. If not, I'd likely use it as inspiration to create my own visuals.

## [Stress vs. Anxiety: What Are the Differences? by Catherine Renton | August 2021 | Verywell Health](https://www.verywellhealth.com/stress-vs-anxiety-5194726)
* **Credibility**: Catherine Renton is a health journalist who worked in healthcare adminstration and communications for over a decade. The article was medically reviewed by Adjoa Smalls-Mantey, MD, DPhil—a professional with an impressive work history and experience. 
* I like that they mention some common diagnoses in this article. Anxiety diagnosis is "umbrella"ed more under Rachael's subtopic than mine though. Overall, I LOVED the organization and structure of this article. Definitely will use it as inspiration for organization and document design. It's also my most recently published source. 

## [5 Ways to Tell the Difference Between Stress and Anxiety: When to Get Help by Mary Ellen Ellis | March 2020 | Bridges to Recovery](https://www.bridgestorecovery.com/blog/5-ways-to-tell-the-difference-between-stress-and-anxiety-when-to-get-help/)
* **Credibility**: I couldn't find any information on the author. If the article is medically reviewed, the web page does not specify. Bridges to Recovery assists patients and clients globally, and seeks out alternative, hollistic options for health concerns. They are accredited by The Joint Commisssion and certified by the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS).
* This article took a different approach from my other sources by creating a list of five ways to distinguish stress from anxiety. The same information is covered but is presented in a different way. I also liked the section about knowing when to seek help (that I recognize some of my other sources also covered.
